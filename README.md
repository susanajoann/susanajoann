* a recent grad from Northeastern University with a BS in Cybersecurity and Criminal Justice.
* expanding my skills. I'm doing online learning courses, such as Red Team Leader's Digital Forensics course. 
* playing with different cybersecurity tools to learn more by doing! I just experimented with TPot!
* reading books with my two book clubs and playing Stardew Valley. 

### Fun Fact About Me:
I spent all of high school acting in school musicals, until I got a lead role and realized I hated acting. In college, 
I started stage managing Shakespeare productions and finally found my place in theatre.

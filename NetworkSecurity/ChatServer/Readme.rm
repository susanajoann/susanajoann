I used python to create a basic chat application using UDP sockets and jsons.
The server listens on a specific port given as an argument to the program.
The client program has arguments for the server ip address and port. 

When started, a client sends a sign-in message to the server including a username. The server records this information.
The other type of message types are list and Get-info List sends a list of the users logged-into the program to the client.
Get-info is used when a client wants to send a message to another client. The message is done privately from one socket to another, so get-info 
gives the client the appropriate info to complete that task.

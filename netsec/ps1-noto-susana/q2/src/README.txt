I referenced a few documentation webpages to get a refresh ondifferent libraries and commands I was using. I will list the webpageshere:https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html2shttps://pymotw.com/2/select/I used json packets for sending info between the client and the server, because I find them easy to work with and in pastprogramming classes I have used it.My overall implementation was fairly simple and did not usemany different functions in the code. I wanted to ensure my code worked and use this as a refresh on python beforemaking anything pretty with many different functions. Thatalso explains why I did long if/elif functions instead of a switch or something more elegant. I am more familiar with if,so I just stuck to it. I did do research to use select though, as I think that is the bestway to distinquish between the incoming input into the client. It did take me a bit to understand exactly how to use it, but I think its implementation helps the code run smoothly.
